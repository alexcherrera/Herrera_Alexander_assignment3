<p>Tim Roberts is the CEO of the company Tech Distribution and is the only computer store in town that sells three different types of products, which are laptops, desktops, and tablets. Tim Roberts is going to present the two new models of each of the three products but the audience don't know about the third product till the end of presenting the first two products. Tim Roberts wanted to be more involved physically in his company because leading technology magazines recognized it. Tim Roberts told Suzy Miller who is the manager that he was going to be in charge of monitoring inventory. Monitoring Inventory consisted of how much of each product there is in the warehouse, sold, received, and missing. Tim Roberts conducts inventory weekly and noticed that his company was missing money and products and informed Suzy Miller. He later had a meeting and discussed what had to be done to resolve this problem from happening again. Later after following Tim Roberts procedures the company did not have any problems and increased their profits. </p>
